## Summary and Motivation:
Covid-19 has made a devastating impact on the world. In the US alone, over 22 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19. When looking into the travel industry, “the Covid-19 Pandemic has resulted in over $500 billion in cumulative losses for the U.S travel economy, equating to a daily loss of approximately $1.75 billion for the past nine-and-a-half months.” - U.S. Travel Association. According to the extensive impact scenario, the initial containment measures taken by the governments were estimated to affect the global aviation industry alone by approximately 130 billion U.S. dollars loss of annual passenger revenue. Nonetheless, as the outbreak exceeds 40.6 million infected people around the globe, the International Air Transport Association updated its estimates as covid numbers continues to spike. 

Team Analytics Alliance decided to look at the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry, comparing 2019 to 2020. 

## Questions We Researched:
- [How has the coronavirus affected the volume of passengers between 2019 and 2020?](https://github.com/llhabers/data-analysis-project-1/tree/main/jini)
- [How has the coronavirus affected the number of domestic flights between 2019 and 2020?](https://github.com/llhabers/data-analysis-project-1/tree/main/latisha)
- [What was the financial impact on the airline industry in terms of revenue?](https://github.com/llhabers/data-analysis-project-1/tree/main/mario)
- [What was the impact on airline fares?](https://github.com/llhabers/data-analysis-project-1/tree/main/samori)
- [Which airports were most busy?](https://github.com/llhabers/data-analysis-project-1/tree/main/ivana)

Each question is hyperlinked to the full report and analysis respectively, as well as the individual jupyter notebooks.
