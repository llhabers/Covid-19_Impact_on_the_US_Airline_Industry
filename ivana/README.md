Team Analytics Alliance
Ivana's Project Results and Observations
How has the coronavirus affected the number of international flights between 2019 and 2020?
Website where Ivana pulled Airline Data for 2019 and 2020: htpp://data.world/tylerudite/airports-airlines-and-routes/workspace/file?filename=airlines.csv 

Situation:
Covid-19 has made a devastating impact on the world. In the US alone, over 22 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19. When looking into the travel industry, “the Covid-19 Pandemic has resulted in over $500 billion in cumulative losses for the U.S travel economy, equating to a daily loss of approximately $1.75 billion for the past nine-and-a-half months.” - U.S. Travel Association. Team Analytics Alliance decided to look at into the airline industry to see Covid-19 impact.

Task:
I wanted to show the number of airports international countries between 2019 and 2020. Based on data study, I present two charts to present the top 10 countries and top 10 time zones with the most airports.

Action:
To answer this question, I research which database should I look into to get accurate data. I came across the website “https://data.world/tylerudite/airports-airlines-and-routes” I was able to find CSV files that has the number of interntional airports from 2019 and 2020. I was able to clean and manipulate the data to extract the information I needed. I removed columns that wasn’t necessary for my findings, change the name of columns and looked at the 7698 airports among the international countries.

Results:
After cleaning and manipulate the data, I was able to create two bar graphs. The first bar graph represents the numbers of airports in the top 10 countries. 
The second bar graphs represent the number of airports based on 10 different time zones. From the chart we can tell the USA has the most airports and it has 3 time more airports then second country Canada.

Observation:
•USA has the most airports in the world. Based on charts we can strongly assume the COVID-19 impact has affected the USA airline business in comparison with other countries.

Challenges:
The challenge I experience while answering my question was looking for right data regarding the airports in the world and trying to figure out how to narrow my search to get the information and the answer I’m looking for.
