## LaTisha's Project Results and Observations

### How has the coronavirus affected the number of domestic flights between 2019 and 2020?

#### Website where LaTisha pulled Airline Data for 2019 and 2020: - https://www.bts.gov/topics/airlines-and-airports-0

##### Situation:
Covid-19 has made a devastating impact on the world. In the US alone, over 22 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19. When looking into the travel industry, “the Covid-19 Pandemic has resulted in over $500 billion in cumulative losses for the U.S travel economy, equating to a daily loss of approximately $1.75 billion for the past nine-and-a-half months.”  - U.S. Travel Association. Team Analytics Alliance decided to look at into the airline industry to see Covid-19 impact.

##### Task:
I wanted to compare the number of domestic flights taken between 2019 and 2020. I posed the question, how has the coronavirus affected the number of domestic flights between 2019 and 2020?

##### Action:
In order to answer this question, I research which database should I look into to get accurate data. I came across the website “Bureau of Transportation Statistics.” I was able to find CSV files that has the number of domestic flights from 2019 and 2020. I was able to clean and manipulate the data to extract the information I needed to compare 2019 domestic flight data against 2020 domestic flight data. I removed columns that wasn’t necessary for my findings, change the name of columns and looked at the Airlines who had over 130,000 flights in 2019.

##### Results:
After cleaning and manipulate the data, I was able to create two bar graphs. The first bar graph represents the percentage change in flight between Airlines from 2019 and 2020. The second bar graphs represent the airline companies and the number of flights (in millions) that took place. The blue graph represents total number of flights for that airline company in 2019 and the orange bar represents the total number of airline flights for the same company 2020.

##### Observation:
•	United Airlines had the highest percentage change in the number of flights between 2019 and 2020. (65.98%)
•	United Parcel Service (UPS) had the lowest percentage change in flights between 2019 and 2020. (16.90%)
•	FedEx and UPS were the only two mail service that was a part of the top companies with a high number of domestic flights.
•	All top airline companies experience an over 45% negative percentage change in the total number of domestic flights between 2019 and 2020 with the exception of UPS.
•	Southwest, Delta and American Airlines were the only companies to have over 1,000,000 domestic flights in 2019.
•	In 2020, all top airlines had less than 1,000,000 domestic flights.
•	The total number of flights taken in 2019 is 9771281.
•	The total number of flights taken in 2019 is 4577349.
•	The change in the number of flights from top airlines from 2019 to 2020 is -53.0%. In other words, in 2020, the number of flights from around the world decline over 50%.

##### Challenges:
The challenge I experience while answering my question was looking at all the airline companies in the world and trying to figure out how to narrow my search to get the answer I’m looking for. The original bar graph I created at first was extremely long due to have all airline companies. I also saw some airline companies with very little flights between 2019 and 2020. To by-pass this obstacle, I decided to focus solely on domestic airline flights that flew over 130,000 times.
