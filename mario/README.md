How has the coronavirus affected the number of domestic flights between 2019 and 2020?

Link to the original data: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements_Financial.aspx?Data=6

Task:
How were flight companies affected by changes in travel/travel restrictions?

Action:
To develop an answer, I pulled data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics covering Net Income for all U.S carriers across all regions. The data provides quarterly revenue from 2000-2020. For this question I limited the data to the past 5 years. This provides a short term overview of revenue prior to the virus outbreak and the effects it had on U.S. airline revenue during 2020.

Results:
The first analysis provides a visual of the total domestic flight revenue over the past 5 years. The visual illustrates the drastic loss in annual revenue.

The second analysis provides a visual of the total international flight revenue over the past 5 years. The visual demonstrates an increase in international flights, uncommon in the years prior to the pandemic outbreak.

The third analysis calculates an average for quarterly revenue per year. This was done to show the difference in average yearly revenue over the past five years, highlighting the drop for 2020.
